### Coding Quizzes:

- Beginning on Thursday, Jan 31, there will be a quiz nearly every Thursday. The quiz will require writing C++ code, or correcting errors in C++ code, or filling in blanks in provided code to complete a C++ function/class/program.

### Course Objectives:

- 1. Develop and use appropriate algorithms.
- 2. Know that there are typically many algorithms for the same task (for example, searching and sorting).
- 3. Implement a divide-and-conquer algorithm to solve an appropriate problem (binary search).
- 4. Have an introductory knowledge of the time/space efficiency of various algorithms.
- 5. Understand structured programming in terms of modules and functions.
- 6. Understand how to separate source code into multiple files, including header (.h) files.
- 7. Use pointer variables and memory operations.
- 8. Resize an array with dynamic memory allocation.
- 9. Delete allocated memory to avoid memory leaks.
- 10. Create and use simple linked-lists.
- 11. Insert into, delete from, and traverse a linked structure.
- 12. Understand the principle of the Abstract Data Type (ADT) and, in particular, the separation of interface and implementation.
- 13. Implement user-defined data structures in a high-level language.
- 14. Compare and contrast the costs and benefits of dynamic and static data structure implementations.
- 15. Have an introductory understanding of object-oriented programming.
- 16. Write a program using an array of objects.
- 17. Design, implement, test, and debug simple programs in an object-oriented programming language.
- 18. Describe how the class mechanism supports encapsulation and information hiding.
- 19. Write programs that use each of the following data structures: arrays, structures, strings, and linked lists.
- 20. Describe and understand concepts of Stacks and Queues.
- 21. Be able to create, compile, and run a program in a Unix style, command-line environment.
